- Inclusion

Goals:

- We wish to build technology for the good of people outside of market, profit-driven and NGO structures.
- Accesible to those of all classes, abilities, etc
- To give a constructive outlet to use their skills for the common good
- Open Source, transparency
- Spread awareness and technological familiarity to those that normally don't have access to those resources.

Actions:
